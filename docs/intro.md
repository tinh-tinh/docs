# Introduce

Tinh Tinh is a framework for building efficient scalable Golang server side applications. It is a [Nest](https://docs.nestjs.com) expired web framework built on top of net/http for Go. Designed to ease things up for fast development with zero memory allocation and performance in mind.

These docs for Tinh Tinh, which was released on September 15th, 2024.

## Philosophy

In recent years, so have many Go framework release, but plenty of super libraries, helpers, and tools exist for Go, none of them effectively solve the main problem of - Architecture.

Tinh Tinh providers an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by Nest.
